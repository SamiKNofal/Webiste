                            Abstract — During the past recent years, the idea of applying smart systems in homes and industrial operations 
                            has been introduced to allow more controllability and functionality for the user. Using internet of things (IoT), 
                            many industries and sectors such as smart cities, energy and resources, healthcare, logistics and retail, manufacturing 
                            and processes, and government and public services can become more technically driven environment. Through the 
                            amalgamation of hardware and software with the internet, IoT is proven to be the next leap for technological 
                            advancement.

                            experience with intelligent service features and real-time system monitoring and optimization. This can be applied for 
                            industrial automation systems to offer a better and enhanced predictable and fault- tolerant system for future proofing.

                        <div class="SectionSubParag">
                            The main concept of introducing IoT devices is to automatically monitor and control the performance of equipment 
                            in manufacturing industries and plants by displaying the data anywhere at any time whenever an internet connection 
                            is available. This provides critical information for the engineer to determine whether they should schedule maintenance 
                            for the affected devices or not. Failure to do so would results in equipment malfunction and longer downtime and 
                            production loss. Different methods can be applied to determine the overall performance of the system, this include 
                            performing vibration test for electrical motors, determining the temperature of the operated equipment, and in special 
                            cases applying image processing techniques to observe the time- lapsed version of the system response over long 
                            period of operation. These abnormalities can be difficult to detect without using specialized tools and sensors. 
                            Therefore, the introduction of internet cloud-based embedded electronic devices are used to automatically maintain 
                            and control proper operation of the system. The action of detecting faults or threats in a device before they occur 
                            and implementing repairs on it to reduce failure is called “predictive maintenance.” Predictive maintenance is a set 
                            of activities that detect changes in the physical condition of equipment (signs of failure) to carry out the 
                            appropriate maintenance work for maximizing the service life of equipment without increasing the risk of failure [1].

                        <div class="SectionSubParag">
                            Much emphasis has been given to the research and development of high-speed machine systems possessing high levels of 
                            programmability and reconfigurability. Motion cycle demands in such machines are high; motors and drives are required 
                            to perform under demanding conditions, hence the need for a predictive maintenance system. Modern machines typically 
                            use some form of direct current (DC) motor and the process described is based upon such motors. The DC motor is one 
                            of the first machines devised to convert electrical power into mechanical power. Recent improvements in DC machines, 
                            and specifically the emergence of the brushless motor have led to its wide usage due to its high torque and small 
                            size when compared to induction motors [2].

                            This paper discusses how predictive maintenance strategies are used to monitor the health of a DC motor under 
                            various conditions by applying vibration tests using the data obtained from an accelerometer module. These tests 
                            are used to analyze and interpret the data in the frequency domain with the help of Fourier equations. Any shift 
                            in the frequencies during normal conditions can be analyzed to detect any failures in the motor. This form of 
                            digital signal processing technique is reliable and cost-effective solution to be implement for industrial 
                            applications. However, both the given load and speed of the motor should be considered when performing this type 
                            of analysis, since the dominant frequencies can shift based on different factors. This implies that different data 
                            acquisition should be added and analyzed to conclude whether the observed results are due to system errors or 
                            otherwise.

                            One of the most cost-effective maintenance techniques is using predictive maintenance which utilizes actual 
                            operating condition of equipment, material, and systems to optimize manufacturing operation. Standard predictive 
                            maintenance management program utilizes a combination of most cost- effective tools (e.g., vibration monitoring, 
                            process parameter monitoring, thermography, tribology, visual inspection) to obtain the actual operating conditions 
                            of critical plant systems. These actual manufacturing data are used to schedule all maintenance activities on an 
                            as-needed basis. Utilizing predictive maintenance in maintenance management program improves the ability to optimize 
                            the availability of process machinery and greatly reduces the cost of maintenance and improves production quality [3]. 
                            Predictive maintenance not only predicts a future failure, but also pinpoints problems in our complex machinery and 
                            helps identify what parts need to be fixed to minimize cost and maximize uptime operation. A simple representation 
                            graph of predictive maintenance strategy can be seen in Fig. 1 that identifies when it is the optimum time an engineer 
                            should schedule a maintenance.

                            The architecture for the overall system is represented in Fig. 14 from Appendix A which will define how the system 
                            will function. This model assumes that the system is capable to be implemented in real-time operations. The model 
                            can be classified into four main stages these include: signal acquisition and preprocessing, data analysis and 
                            processing, system monitoring and control, and web-based data logging. These stages will be summarized in detail 
                            in the next upcoming sections of this report. The system will operate using a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip, with a 
                            full TCP/IP stack and microcontroller capability. This allows the user to utilize the microcontroller to handle 
                            all the system operation and provide Wi-Fi connectivity to be integrated with IoT applications.

                        <div class="SectionSubParag">
                            The first step to perform predictive maintenance is to acquire the data provided by each individual sensor. Analog 
                            sensors can be directed to any peripherals of the microcontroller that support ADC capability. These peripherals 
                            should be able to provide high sampling resolution, good SQNR, unity gain, and good dynamic range. If the ADC 
                            circuit lacks some of these specifications, a simple hardware solution can be used to minimize noise interference 
                            using electronic low-pass (anti-aliasing) filter prior to the ADC in case of low SQNR or limit the input voltage 
                            range using high efficiency buck converter circuit. In some cases, a microcontroller might not have enough ADC pins 
                            for multiple analog data. This can be overcome by using a high-speed CMOS logic analog MUX/DEMUX circuit to switch 
                            between multiple analog sensors using a single ADC pin. These important points are necessary to determine the analog 
                            speed and temperature of the DC motor.

                            Speed measurement of electronic motors can be done in several ways. One method to read the speed of the motor is to 
                            measure the electrical signals of the light transferred between two isolated circuits using a light generating 
                            photodiode and light sensing phototransistor connected between the radial load of the motor’s shaft. This form of 
                            sensor measurement can be found in optocoupler circuits, where the voltage generated from the optocoupler can be 
                            interpreted as an AC square wave signal. This signal can be fed directly to the microcontroller to measure the total 
                            RPM of the motor. Measuring the signal directly will require additional signal processing and conditioning techniques 
                            and higher sampling rate which might affect the accuracy of the readings. Since predictive maintenance strategy relies 
                            heavily on the speed parameter of the motor, a better and more accurate solution is to use a frequency-to-voltage 
                            converter circuit to convert the frequency of the square wave signal to analog DC voltage for ADC measurements

                            To determine the temperature of the motor during operation, a contact type, linearly proportional analog centigrade 
                            temperature sensor can be attached directly to the motor. For accurate readings, these devices should have low output 
                            impedance to simplify interfacing to ADC circuit. The performance characteristics of the output signal voltage vs 
                            temperature slop can be scaled and offset to meet the desired temperature range. This type of modification can be 
                            done using a simple negative-feedback operational amplifier circuit as shown in Fig. 2.

                            to the microcontroller’s analog input peripheral pin. The transfer function that describes the relationship between 
                            the non-inverting input and output voltage of the amplifier is given as follows:

                            To achieve the desired gain and offset for a linearly proportional analog sensor, the straight-line equation 
                            is used. For a 10-bit ADC circuit, a simple TMP36 temperature sensor can be configured to operate between -10 °C 
                            and 50 °C (0.4- 1V) instead of its entire range of -25 °C and 150 °C (0.2-1.8V) using the circuit introduced in 
                            Fig. 2 for a motor predictive maintenance prototype. This is done to include the entire range of ADC for higher 
                            accuracy of sampled readings. Therefore, the aim is to scale and offset the range of the sensor so that the 
                            microcontroller receives 0V when the sensor outputs 0.4V and 5V when it outputs 1V as it can be seen from the

                            The gradient of the plot in the above figure can be worked out to be approximately 8.34, then determining the 
                            intercept by setting y = 0 (x = 0.4) so that the straight-line equation can be written as follows:

                            Therefore, an overall gain of 8.34 with an offset of 0.4V (which will also be amplified by 8.34) is required. Using the 
                            transfer function of the non-inverting amplifier, a resistive ratio of 7.34 is obtained, thus the value of R3 from Fig. 2 
                            must be at least 10 times greater than the anticipated value of R2. Assuming a value of R3 = 10kΩ, R4 must be equal to 
                            73.4kΩ (nearest E12 series combination is 68kΩ and 5.6kΩ). The voltage across R2 must be 0.4V (the required offset). 
                            With a Vs = 5 volts and selecting R2 = 1kΩ, R1 is found to equal 11.5kΩ (nearest E12 series combination is 6.8kΩ and 
                            4.7kΩ), however R1 may need tweaking to achieve ideal scaling.

                            Another form of temperature sensor that can be utilized is the non-contact type sensor such as IR sensors. However, 
                            these sensors are not considered an ideal use for industrial applications since they rely on the space optical 
                            transmission for thermal measurement; therefore, the environment needs to be clean, without dust, high humidity, 
                            or similar which might not be the case for industry-base environment.

                            When dealing with digital sensors and DSP chips, they can provide processed digital data using different 
                            communication protocols such as UART, I2C, and SPI. The microcontroller architecture should be flexible to 
                            handle these form of communication protocols in case they are needed to be called. These digital sensors can 
                            be configured to provide accurate readings by passing the data to a signal filtering and conditioning circuits 
                            available on the module IC before data transmission to the microcontroller. However, for high speed/precision 
                            applications, further filtering techniques must be implemented to compensate for any data drift and overshoot 
                            errors, this can be done multiple ways based on the computational power of the microcontroller such as applying 
                            sensor fusion techniques or implementing a more complex algorithm such as Kalman filter. It is more sensible 
                            though, to allow an internet cloud server to handle the heavy complicated processes that otherwise cannot be

                            Generally, the IMU unit will be configured to output the three-axis accelerometer data to calculate the 
                            average RMS acceleration. Since the RMS value of a signal represents the average (mean) power, the total 
                            energy of a signal is preserved under the Fourier transform based on Parseval's theorem; therefore, the sum

                            the most useful value for vibration test since it directly relates to the energy content of the vibration profile 
                            and thus the destructive capability of the vibration. RMS also considers the time history of the wave form. Fourier 
                            transformation of a signal can be implemented to observe the dominant frequencies in the vibration test and determine 
                            the acceptable shift in frequencies based on the speed and temperature of the motor until a maintenance is required 
                            to be performed. To compute the Fourier transform for a discrete-time system, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)

                            signal x[n]. Hence as the name implies, it is a computational method of calculating the discrete Fourier transform 
                            significantly faster than directly computing it. The FFT reduces the number of computations needed for a problem of 
                            size N from N^2 to N×log⁡N. This algorithm can be represented by separating the DFT into even and odd indexed

                            Both sub-sequences can be summed together giving an advantage of computing the even and odd indexed sub-sequences

                            The algorithm can be further improved by applying the divide-and-conquer approach, halving the computational cost 
                            each time. In other words, it is possible to continue to split the problem size until a group of two are left then 
                            directly compute the DFT for each of those pairs [4]. This form of signal analysis can be done either directly from 
                            the microcontroller or indirectly through cloud computing. As mentioned previously, the processed FFT data is dependent 
                            on the speed and temperature of the motor. This is because any shift in the frequencies relies on the given power of the 
                            motor, and thus on the measured speed and overall temperature. For example, if the power applied to the motor remains 
                            constant and the measured speed and temperature match the expected values, then the Fourier analysis results should 
                            correlate to these conditions. However, when the motor does not maintain proper operation at a given power, then either 
                            the speed, temperature, or both values will show unexpected results.

                            In terms of long period of measurements and prediction strategy, one cannot rely on a single data alone. 
                            Combining both speed and temperature data with vibration test provides the engineer a better insight to determine 
                            the expected time of equipment failure and when it is necessary to perform maintenance procedure. Other useful 
                            data that can be included for the test is ambient temperature and humidity measurement which can be used to determine 
                            the cause of failure for a better understanding of the problem.

                            Once all the data has been gathered and processed, the next step is to decide how to implement it to maintain 
                            and control the system. Data obtained from vibration test can be used for both FFT evaluation in future prediction 
                            and real-time monitoring for the state of electrical machines. This can be done by using a standard vibration 
                            severity chart based on ISO 10816 as a guidance for evaluating vibration severity in machines operating in the 10 
                            to 200Hz (600 to 12,000 RPM) frequency range as shown in Table 1. Examples of these types of machines are small, 
                            direct-coupled, electric motors and pumps, production motors, medium motors, generators, steam and gas turbines, 
                            turbo-compressors, turbo-pumps, and fans.

                            An emergency system should be used in case the machine reaches an unacceptable vibration severity by either 
                            automatically or manually controlling the system to maintain proper safety and operation. This can be monitored 
                            and controlled traditionally from a local centralized system or internet cloud-based centralized system where any 
                            important information is accessible to directly notify maintenance experts in charge real time, anytime, when a 
                            schedule is generated without them having to physical move to the plant. This helps decrease maintenance cost and 
                            increase efficiency and production time.

                            For a prototype system model, the microcontroller can be programmed using different software compiler languages such 
                            as C, C++, and Python scripts to perform data acquisition and digitization. Chip level programming uses field 
                            programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware circuits to develop IC devices optimized for a specific load. This is 
                            essential when developing high speed hardware communication chips for IoT applications. Fortunately, many low-cost 
                            Wi-Fi microchips, with a full microcontroller capability are available to use for testing and prototype purposes. 
                            Therefore, these microchips contain the necessary circuits for both data acquisition and wireless communication.

                            While it is (barely) possible to do FFT on a microcontroller-based system, it is more ideal to do signal processing 
                            of this sort by passing the data to a local or cloud computing hub for monitoring and post-processing analysis. 
                            This ensures that the microcontroller focuses on data gathering and handling wireless communication protocol. In 
                            case the system detects an unacceptable operation from the electrical machine, it is suitable to implement an 
                            emergency detection and prevention system to quickly counter this problem. For our prototype system this can be 
                            done manually or automatically. For manual control, an external interrupt pin can be used as an indication to cut 
                            the power fed to the electrical machine through a relay switch. Automatic control applies a conditional limit to 
                            the system based on the vibration severity per ISO 10816 standard. Once the vibration severity has reached a critical 
                            or unacceptable level, the microcontroller will send a confirmation signal to disable the power input on the motor.

                            This section discusses how data monitoring and logging through a web server host is achieved to provide an insight 
                            on how IoT technology is implemented. One additional and important component in developing a functional IoT was the 
                            Internet Protocol version 6 (IPV6) for its remarkably intelligent decision to increase address space. The address 
                            space expansion means that assigning an IPV6 address to every device on the surface of the earth is still sufficient,
                            still have enough addresses left to do another 100+ earths. In other words, running out of internet addresses is not 
                            going to happen anytime soon. When thinking of the IoT, consider the idea, “any device capable, can be interconnected 
                            with other devices.” The IoT is ripe for new and creative ideas to add to the tasks already in use [5]. 
                        </div>

                        <div class="SectionSubParag">
                            This opens doors for big data engineers to gather numerous information from each and every interconnected IoT devices 
                            to be used for optimizing the system and conclude future predictions for a better and more cost-effective solutions to 
                            be used. However, with the increase application and IoT devices, several challenges with implementing security within 
                            an IoT network arises. First, IoT systems are heterogeneous. There are different types of devices, methods of 
                            communication, types of data being transferred and shared, various resource levels of devices, and system 
                            configurations. Each distinct element adds to the challenge of effectively secure IoT.  
                        </div>

                        <div class="SectionSubParag">
                            A second challenge inheres in the number of devices that are connected together. Billions of devices connected 
                            together provides a new research area of focus when considering nominal function, resiliency, and security as well. 
                            To address these challenges in securing IoT devices, we propose using machine learning within an IoT gateway to help 
                            secure the system. Machine learning is an area of A.I in which computer programs are enabled to learn from experience, 
                            examples, and analogies. As learning occurs, the capabilities within the program become more intelligent and the 
                            program becomes capable of making informed decisions [6]. When implementing IoT in smart industry domains, these 
                            security measurements should be used to insure proper protection against cyber-attacks such as distributed denial 
                            of service (DDoS), cross-site scripting, and watering hole attacks to help companies in regulated industries by 
                            managing and maintaining enhanced infrastructures for compliance and to protect personal and financial data. However, 
                            the topic of machine learnings and A.I for big data analysis and security is beyond the scope of this paper and will 
                            not be covered, yet it is worth mentioning these points out since they play an important role when dealing with IoT 
                            technologies.

                        <div class="SectionSubParag">
                            For a prototype model, the given Wi-Fi microchip, with a microcontroller capability can be used as a stand-alone 
                            server for web hosting and data logging. Therefore, the module will behave as an access point beacon by allowing 
                            multiple devices (clients) to connect to it through its own IP, gateway, and subnet. A separate Hyper Text Markup 
                            Language (HTML) file is stored in the chip’s flash memory to display the web page contents and handle both the root 
                            and form requests. The module will operate using a standard 2.5 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band, other high-end microchips 
                            can operate on both 2.5 and 5 GHz bands for highspeed bandwidth transmission. Data logging is generally done through 
                            database server that stores organized information in the form of tables using different database services. To simulate 
                            this form of data logging, the microchips and/or microcontrollers have a dedicated organized arrays of floating-gate 
                            transistors circuit for memory storage known as electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). 
                            This form of memory stores data in the form of a single byte (8 bits). Table 2 shows the total number of bytes 
                            required to store different data types based on a 32-bit and 64-bit data model. It should be noted that an EEPROM 
                            has a limited life for erasing and reprogramming, now reaching a million operations in modern EEPROMs. The life 
                            cycle for EEPROM is an important consideration when deciding which type of data must be stored on it.

                            A miniaturized hardware model for the purposed prototype predictive maintenance motor project to be implemented 
                            in smart industry domain is designed on a two layered printed circuit board. The final circuit board with all the 
                            components is shown in Fig 10 from Appendix A. The circuit operates on a 12V DC input voltage and a power conditioning 
                            circuit through a linear voltage regulator to lower the input voltage to 10V and 5V to match the recommended operation 
                            of each individual module. The 12V DC motor is connected to an h-bridge circuit to control both the speed and direction 
                            from 0V to 10V using a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal. Ambient and motor analog temperature readings are measured 
                            using the scaling and offsetting process via a non-inverting amplifier configuration introduced in section II part B. 
                            Another form of ambient temperature and humidity measurement is applied using a digital sensor for referencing and 
                            correction. A frequency to voltage converter IC chip that operates directly from the 12V supply is used to convert the 
                            pulses measured by the optocoupler circuit to an analog voltage format. To overcome the issue of having a single or 
                            limited number of ADC pins, a MUX/DEMUX IC DIL chip is used to switch between each individual sensor readings. Data 
                            obtained from the accelerometer is achieved through I2C communication protocol between the module and the microcontroller. 
                            Additionally, a 128 by 32 pixels OLED screen is connected on the same I2C bus to display measured data and various icons 
                            to indicate different operations for more added functionality. Finally, an external interrupt button is used to simulate

                            The average and RMS data obtained from the vibration test is sent to a centralized cloud/local system to perform 
                            post-processing for fast Fourier analysis. The microcontroller is programmed to sample the data at Ts = 0.01s at N 
                            number of samples, where N must be a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc). For this vibration test, the total 
                            number of samples N is chosen to be 256. Therefore, the test can be done every 2.55 seconds starting from Ts=0s. The 
                            following results obtained in Fig. 4 and 5 provides the computed FFT when the DC motor runs at 100% PWM signal (10V) 
                            and 50% PWM signal (5V), respectively. An impulse signal is generated at 50Hz frequency when the motor runs at 10V, 
                            which corresponds to a measured speed of 9250 RPM; whereas, at 5V, an impulse signal is generated at 27.75Hz frequency 
                            that corresponds to a measured speed of 4624 RPM.

                            During motor fault, analyzing the FFT output obtained from the vibration test will yield results that does not 
                            correlates to the expected output response. For example, consider the graph given in Fig. 3 when the motor operates 
                            at 100% PWM signal. Whenever a failure occurs in the motor, expect a shift in the frequency of the impulse signal 
                            response observed from the FFT data as shown in Fig. 6. Other results that suggest issues in the system including 
                            undesired impulses that indicates instability of the motor. These analysis with the help of various data obtained 
                            about the behavior of the system can help us understand the scope of the problem and act accordingly by using 
                            predictive maintenance assessment to prevent any future problems.

                        <div class="SectionSubParag">
                            The technology development for IoT is still in its early stages; however, with the help of IPv6, many IoT devices 
                            can be interconnected together through the internet to perform complex operations and gather huge amount of essential 
                            data. This opens doors for big data engineers to analyze and benefit from this technology to perform optimization and 
                            future prediction through the help of machine learning and A.I. Industries are moving towards a smarter and more 
                            interconnected systems with the help of internet and cloud computing. This results in better management by integrating 
                            predictive maintenance strategies, reducing the cost and improves the system’s overall resiliency. One method 
                            introduced in this paper is by performing vibration test using FFT analysis, which when combined with other vibration 
                            tests can be proven to be a powerful method to perform the necessary procedure for predictive analysis.
